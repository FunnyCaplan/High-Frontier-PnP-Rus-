3Module Conflicts

Ñòðàíèöà 3

As Factions expand into the solar system and trade among themselves, they become less dependent on Earth and less tolerant of Earth-centered trade monopolies and regulations. Secessionists start to clamor for Independence and self-governance. But if the War of Independence (War) is declared, the game state changes drastically until it is resolved, with hostilities between the Loyalists M and the Independents B. At stake: will space ventures and pioneers be subject to regulatory governance by terrestrial superpowers and multinational organizations like the UN, or will they become a free trade coalition of self-governing city-states?1
a. Modules. Module 0 must be used, using the Module 3 Political Assembly placard (instead of the Core placard). Modules 1 & 2 are recommended (but not required). All Module 1 & 2 rules are listed in blue font. You can also play with Futures (1D), which can influence combat (3F2).
b. Number of Players. 2 to 6 competitive. Solitaire is not supported.
c. Piracy Variant. Combat is allowed but not mandatory at all times against all opponents, but if your victim is in the same bloc as you, you must pay him a bribe, following the vendetta rules (3D1).2
d. Age of Piracy Variant. Players who want to experience combat without the War of Independence can play the Piracy Variant as above, but without blocs, propaganda, or extremists, and all attacks require paying the defender a bribe. Do not use the 3A2f,g setup, Module 3 political assembly (3B2), propaganda (3B3), war outbreak (3C), ET Home Bernal & Postwar (3F), and War/Anarchy (3D, except faction weapons 3D6, dislodge 3D7 and combat 3D8 are used).
e. Modified Future Wars Variant. A game without combat can use the evade rules (3D3, 4, 5) to modify Wars of Independence that happen as a result of casus belli Futures (1D2c). As there are no extremist or corrupt delegates (3D2), only your own delegates or allied delegates with permission can be petitioned to evade.
f. Software Versions. Tabletop Simulator by Justin Grey, VASSAL by Stefano Tin?.
1COVER ART by Josefin Strand depicts an attack on a cometary mining factory using a laser-heated missile with a beamed gray goo warhead. In general, facilities on comets and asteroids are hardened targets, with their facilities either mobile or deep underground. Although this is a violation of exoplanetary law, they can be infected with nanites capable of replicating using sunlight and regolith. Another attack strategy takes advantage of the fact that many comets are covered with low density amorphous water-ice (ASW), a type of ice stable in the outer Solar System. If a chain reaction is initiated, runaway recrystallization of this ice can cause it to explode.
2BLOOD CREDITS. The bribe gained by a pirate’s victim simulates, not a share of the booty, but rather a blood bribe that gives the victim a justifiable cause for revenge or justice. This is not just talk, such eye-for-an-eye justice is respected by others considering joining the victim's cause.
TIP (Modules 1 & 2): In a Futures game with Module 3, you can no longer safely ignore the political arena just because it is overshadowed by other sources of VP. [3Aa]
EASILY MISSED (Module 2): Both your faction privileges (B6a) and faction weapons (3D6) are shutdown unless you have a Home Bernal (either per 2B3 or 3F1). [3Aa]
EASILY MISSED: If using Module 1, the delivery operation (I9) can’t be used, see 1A8. [3Aa]
TIP: Age of Piracy is a good way to try out the combat rules, or if you are playing a shorter game (e.g. only 48 years or without Modules 1 & 2). [3Ad]

3A1. Module 3 Components
1 Drawer Box.
2 Rulebooks. These rules plus a Strategy Guide
6 Playmats. 1 per player.
2 Player Aids.
1 Module 3 Political Assembly Placard.
12 Bribe Disks. Black, see 3B1
6 Dropstone Tokens. Place on the map if a dropstone is dislodged (3D7) to show the location of its stack.
6 Propaganda Chits. Setup per 3A2f. Flipped per 3B3a,b,c. Determines victory in War per 3F4.
11 Damage Chits. Indicators for Factory damage (3E7c).
1 Red Cross Chit. Indicator for cancer hospital (3E9d).
1 Lutetia Site Chit. (optional Punch out).
5 POW Chits. Special glory chits (3D9c).
1 Six-sided dice. You will also need one six-sided dice from the Core Game
3 Ziplock Bags

OPTIONAL: The latest findings from the Rosetta spacecraft found no hydrated minerals on the asteroid Lutetia (k 8:30), contrary to 2004 data. We have provided a hexshaped chit that you may place on the map to use the latest data. [3A1]
3A2. Module 3 Setup
Setup is per core setup (C), with the following additions:
a. Module 3 Political Assembly & Seniority Disks (C1). Use the Module 3 Political Assembly. Place 4 Seniority Disks on its center for a short game, 5 for an intermediate game or 7 if playing Futures (Modules 1 & 2).
b. Assign Factions & Crew. Players divide themselves into Independence and Loyalist blocs, then each bloc among themselves assigns factions to each player (use dice if necessary). There must be at least one Loyalist M player [Purple (socialist), Yellow (nationalist), or White (globalist)] plus one Independence B player [Green (unionist), Gray (individualist), or Red (entrepreneur)].
c. Starting Aqua. Same as in Core (C5) (Aqua per player = the number of patent decks used). If quick start (V1) is used, start with zero Aqua
d. Starting Bribe. Each player takes 3 bribes (black disks) into their Reserves (only 2 bribes in a 5- or 6-player game)
e. Starting Playmat & Dropstone. Each player takes the playmat of his faction color and puts the plastic dropstone of his color and puts it on the spot with the dropstone picture.

Ñòðàíèöà 5

f. Propaganda Chits are placed on the circles on the political assembly placard. Freedom, individuality, and equality are placed Independence B bloc up, and honor, unity, and authority are placed Loyalist M bloc up, as shown. No propaganda chit is used for centrist.3
g. Extremist Delegates. Each player starts with one delegate placed in his color of Ideology. Unlike Core, place your delegate on top of the propaganda chit that sits in the color of your Ideology. As long as it remains on the propaganda, this is your extremist delegate (3B2a).4
3A3. Core/Module 0-2 Rule Changes
Module 3 replaces the Core rules during Anarchy (K2e) and War, notably by restricting certain activities (3D4, 3D5), and allowing combat and Felonies against enemies but not allies.
a. Felonious. During War/Anarchy, all players gain an Ability equivalent to the Felonious faction privilege (per K2e), but only Player Purple can use this Ability against allies.
b. Dropstone Stacks (add to E3). This is a new Stack created by the dislodge operation (3D7b). 5 You may only have 1 dropstone Stack. A new placard is provided with a slot for this Stack. After being created, cards cannot be moved into or out of dropstone Stacks (they may be Decommissioned normally). If at any time the dropstone Stack does not contain an Operational thruster meeting the requirements described in 3D7c, the Stack is Decommissioned. Dropstone Stacks are immune to events and combat (except as specified in 3D7d) on the 2nd and later turns of their dislodgement (3D7e,f).
EASILY MISSED: Felonious and Felonies are unchanged in Module 3. [3A3a]
3 INDEPENDENCE. In designing a game about a War of Independence, I have spent just as much effort simulating Independence as the War! This was the whole point of the bloodshed, and I wanted the War’s outcome to make a difference in how the High Frontier proceeds postwar. Independence is a step further out, getting humankind closer to the stars. This module introduces a tipping point when the internal market in space generates as much human values and profits as does trade with Earth. It also illustrates some of the consequences: ugly politics, space colonies moving further out, Anarchy, vendettas, embargoes, crash of the Aqua currency, and Home Bernals orbiting other planets.
4 EXTREMIST is an uncompromising ideologue, and the leading representative of an ideological bloc. The game's ideologies are arranged so that opposites lie on opposed sides of the hexagonal political assembly. For example, there is obviously no compromise possible between the meritocracy of honor and the egalitarianism of equality. Likewise freedom and authority are opposites, as are individualism and unity
5 DROPSTONES. On Earth, these are boulders embedded in sedimentary rock that originally were dropped into the ocean bed from the underside of melting ice-sheets. In this game, these are boulders or icebergs blasted off of small asteroids, and then deorbited into a flyby of Sol or a giant planet. During the closest approach in the flyby, mass drivers are used for an Oberth thrust multiplier, sending the bolide into a target for a kinetic kill. Practical places for this attack are moonlets or comets that are just barely captured by Sol or the planet, so that only a small delta-v is needed to deorbit them. The propellant for the attack is derived by sacrificing part of the bolide itself.

Ñòðàíèöà 6

c. Kamikaze Stacks (add to E3). This is a new transient Stack created when making a kamikaze attack (3E5). You may have any number of kamikaze Stacks, but they are Decommissioned the turn they are created when they attack (or at the end of combat if unable to attack).
d. Intercept Movement (add to H1). If during War/Anarchy your Spacecraft enters a Space occupied by an enemy Spacecraft (Rocket, Freighter, Mobile Factory, or Bernal Stack), it must halt (and combat occurs at the end of all your movement).6
"e. Dive-Bombing Movement/Landing (H5e, H6). A Stack with a thruster or Freighter and no Humans can declare a dive-bomb during its movement. This allows it to move through lander burns to an associated Site as if they were lagrange spaces (not requiring Burns). The Stack is required to attack as a kamikaze weapon (3E5) during Combat that turn; if unable to attack, it is Decommissioned at the end of the Turn."
f. Lobby (O4 of Module 0). This free action is unchanged during peacetime: Decommission a delegate and pay 1 Aqua to use an inactive Law in that Ideology. However, a corrupted delegate (3D2) cannot be used to lobby. During War/Anarchy, all Laws are nullified and cannot be lobbied.
g. War/Anarchy Colonist Limit (2Ca of Module 2). Unlike peacetime, when the number of Colonists is strictly limited to the number of Anchored Bernals (plus 1 per promoted Bernal), during War/Anarchy colonist limits are modified to be equal to the number of Bernals (both Anchored and unanchored, plus 1 per promoted Bernal). However, your exomigration is blocked unless you have evaded the War/Anarchy restriction on exomigration by petitioning a delegate in the freedom ideology (3D5a). Once War/Anarchy ends, normal exomigration rules (2A6) are reimposed
h. Faction Privilege/Weapon Locked (2B3b of Module 2). If you have no Home Bernal Anchored, then not only is your faction privilege locked, but also your faction weapon (3D6) is locked as well.
i. Miner Profession (2C1a of Module 2). For their professional ability, a miner provides an additional refuel when taking the site refuel operation (I5), including on an Anchored Bernal, instead of a free site refuel.
j. Bank. This term refers to the Space on the map where you your Aqua (or monetized gold beads, see 3B5) are considered to be stored. Your Bank is located in LEO, a Home Bernal (2B3), or an ET Home Bernal (3F1), which ever is furthest from Earth. You may only have one Bank.
EASILY MISSED: Outposts cannot intercept movement. [3A3d]
EASILY MISSED: Delegates can't be Decommissioned unless you are at your cube limit (I7f). [3A3f]
EASILY MISSED (Module 2): Since wartime colonist limits are equal to the number of your Bernal tokens on the map, unless blocked you must exomigrate as soon as you boost or construct a new one. [3A3g]
6NO SHIPPING LANES IN SPACE. The intercept rule and map routes give a false impression that specific preferred routes exist among heliocentric worlds. The velocity difference (delta-V) between them remains constant, but since they orbit at different velocities, the distances between them varies enormously. The game mechanics attempt to resolve this by concentrating on the number of Burns to the destination, rather than the distance. The only spots that are at a constant distance from a planet are gravitationally locked: Sol, Lagrange Points, moons, and Trojans.

3B. Playmat & Political Assembly
Your playmat contains your faction weapon (3D6) and the firing results table (3E2). The reverse side is a player aid
3B1. Bribes (War/Anarchy Only)
Each player starts with 2 or 3 bribes (black disks), see 3A2d. They represent grudges and blackmail rather than wealth,7 and accordingly can be traded or negotiated between players only during peacetime. During War/Anarchy, they are used in 3 ways: to start a vendetta (3D1) or truce (3F3), or to corrupt a delegate (3D2). See example 3D3d.
a. Heroism. You can use a heroism chit (B3) as if it was a bribe (but such chits count zero in endgame VP).
b. Endgame VP. Each bribe you hold at the endgame is worth VP depending upon which bloc won the War (3G1). If the ending Active Law is individuality, each bribe is worth +1 VP (3G1).
3B2. Module 3 Political Assembly & Extremists
The Module 3 political assembly is the same as the Core version,8 with additional information on War Restrictions (3D4, 3D5). It starts with 6 propaganda chits (3A2f), which indicate which Ideologies support loyalists, and which support independents.9
a. Extremist Delegates. A delegate that sits on propaganda is called an extremist delegate, and the propaganda it sits on is called an extremist propaganda.
TIP: During War/Anarchy, having a majority of delegates does not matter, since there is no Active Law and no vote tally. Just one delegate is enough for either lobby or evasion of restrictions. [3B2]
7WEALTH is material goods made by man. This includes water, insofar as it requires time, energy, and work to produce it (especially in space). Water has particular value in LEO, the most thirsty spot in the solar system due to the demands of outgoing rockets. Increased technology and rocketry increases the supply of water and thus equates to more wealth. An ET Home Bernal is a veritable fountain as it supplies cheap water electromagnetically catapulted from the shallow gravity fields of icy worlds. Wealth is distinct and separate from money or monetary value, and falling prices in this case is not a sign of deflation, which is a decrease in the volume of spending in the economic system which cuts profits and makes it harder to pay debts. —George Reisman, The Goal of Monetary Reform, 2000.
8 POLITICS & ECONOMICS are linked. Politics is the science of how people should treat each other for maximum benefit, and economics is the science of how to maximize human values under a particular politics. Normally, if your productivity allows you to be Independent and selfreliant, you favor a politics of laissez-faire freedom, the Independence bloc in this game. But if you are not, you favor authoritarian regulations to redistribute the wealth created by the productive, the Loyalist bloc.
9POLITICAL ASSEMBLY. The game’s political assembly simulates an arena designed to give spacefarers a voice despite their tiny constituency of voters. It is a bit like the U.S. Senate, or the UN Charter, which gives an equal voting share to any state or country regardless how tiny it is. Thus it is favored by the Independence bloc.

b. Extremist Disgraced. If an extremist propaganda is flipped, move its delegate into the corresponding Ideology. Once disgraced, you can never get a new extremist!
c. Your Bloc is indicated by the propaganda in the Ideology of your color (even if your extremist is dead)
d. Diplomatic Propaganda Flip. If you move the Active Law into an Ideology, see 3B3b
e. Immunity. An extremist delegate is immune to Purge Rolls (K2e), martial law (O5d), and corruption (3D2).
3B3. Propaganda
Module 3 adds 6 double-sided chits called propaganda to the political assembly (3A2f). 10 These continuously track which Ideologies support the Loyalists, and which support Independents. If all 6 support one bloc during the War, then War ends with that bloc being victorious (3F4). They are also used to determine desertions (3C3f). Each propaganda can contain one delegate, and if so it is called an extremist propaganda. Flipping an extremist propaganda disgraces its delegate off the chit and into the Ideology per 3B2b. Flipping a propaganda allows you to blackmail a corrupt delegate there, which Discards it and steals its bribe (3D2d). There are 3 ways that a propaganda chit can be flipped (during War/Anarchy or peace):
a. Victorious Attack (preferably flips non-extremist, War/Anarchy only). If your attack is a victorious attack (3D9), then flip one enemy propaganda, which cannot be extremist unless no non-extremists are available. If an extremist is flipped, it must be that of the defeated enemy if possible.
b. Diplomacy (never flips extremist, peacetime only). If you cause the Active Law to shift from one Ideology to another, which results in a vote tally (O3a), you can flip the propaganda of the Ideology of the new position of the Active Law (star) Token, unless it has an extremist.
• Here I Stand. Moving the Active Law to centrist does not flip any propaganda.11
TIP (Module 2): If you have an Anchored Bernal/ Colonists, you should flip the propaganda of the Colonist Ideology to match your bloc. Otherwise, an outbreak of War/Anarchy will induce the Colonist to desert (3F4a). [3B3b]
10 PROPAGANDA. If democracy is in vogue, the political reality is that space folk number in the thousands versus the billions on Earth. If republicanism is respected instead of majority rule, then freedom from arbitrary seizures, trade regulations, and censorship is defended regardless of majority opinion. Another political reality is that, in space, the de facto control lies with the people in-situ, and not with terrestrial politicians. If you read The Martian, by Andy Weir, this point was brilliantly illustrated by the mutiny of the rocket commander, who was obviously of the “honor” rather than the “authority” ideology. Defining a government as the entity with a monopoly of arms and ability to wield force in an area, the government on an asteroid or distant planet will not be anyone Earth-based.
11 CENTRIST DELEGATES are those who do not take a stand or any consistent position. Changing their stance more often than their socks, they rely on pragmatism at the expense of principle. Such pragmatism allows them to finally take a stand and join the winning bloc when it is clear who the winner will be.

Ñòðàíèöà 9

c. Defection (flips your own extremist). As a free action on your Turn, you may flip your extremist propaganda. This disgraces your delegate (i.e. permanently moves it off the chit and into the Ideology). Furthermore, if you have uncolonized Factory(s), you must choose one to convert to the color of one of your enemies (3E2k). At the end of the War, players without extremists are counted among the defeated (3F4d). 12
• Surrender. Defection can also be involuntary, as a result of combat (3B3a). If so, you do not suffer a Factory loss, but are not allowed whistleblowing or sneak attacks (see below).
• Capitulation. If this results in all propaganda being the same bloc, the War ends (in your defeat!) at the end of your Turn, see 3F4.
• Sneak Attack. If you make attacks against your former allies on the Turn of defection, you are allowed to attack first if you play your victim a bribe. You are also allowed Felonies this Turn against your former allies, without needing a bribe.
War breaks out, and you are an Independent. But you have lots of glory, and prefer a Loyalist victory. So you flip your extremist propaganda and defect. You decide to treacherously attack a Independent who is in the lead. You must compensate her with a bribe, and roll first. Whatever the outcome of the attack, you have lost the War, but the Loyalist victory is worth it.
d. Whistleblowing. Flipping a propaganda allows you to blackmail one corrupt delegate in your faction's Ideology (3D2d), which Decommissions its cube and steals its bribe.
TIP: In a 2-player game, you can always end the War by defecting! You lose a Factory. [3B3c]
EASILY MISSED: You never forfeit a Factory unless the defection was voluntary. [3B3c]
3B4. Expanded Freedom To Roam Treaty (Module 2)
The Individuality Law (Freedom to Roam Treaty (O5f)) is expanded to allow the sale of a Black-Side Card if taken to an allied or enemy Bernal, (but not your own!) with the following conditions:13
a. No Snow To Inuits. The Bernal must not be Adjacent to a Dirtside with the same Spectral Type as the BlackSide Card being sold.
"EASILY MISSED (Module 2): The individuality law (O5f) states: ""You may treat an opponent’s Factory or Bernal as your own."" This makes your Bernal public property for On-Site Operations, factory-assist, and Promotions. [3B4]"
12 TREASON is a collectivist term, since it denotes a crime against a country. Thus, it can only be understood by persons who accept a nationalist BSU. For an individualist (such as myself ), crimes can only be objectively defined as against an individual victim, not against a collective such as a country
13 BLACK MARKET is an example of the free market in action, a private response to public regulations. Private and public institutions are frequently confused, perhaps because many speakers twist definitions in order to make a point. For an institution or transaction to be private, it must meet 2 conditions: (1) its funding must be from customers, and (2) its competition must not be under legal regulatory force. If an institution instead gets its funding from taxes, it becomes just another bureaucracy. If its would-be competitors are outlawed, it becomes just another monopoly

Ñòðàíèöà 10

b. Refusal. If the buyer and seller are allied (War or peace), the sale cannot be declined.
c. White Flag during War/Anarchy. If the buyer and seller are enemies, the sale must be negotiated (needs a delegate in honor), and combat against each other’s Tokens within, into, or out of the Bernal Space is forbidden during the Turns of the sale.
d. Your Sales Benefits. You may receive the factory stock price (M2b) in Aqua, taken from the Pool. Additionally, you may negotiate (N) for additional benefits (e.g. Aqua, Hand cards, isotopes, etc.).
e. Bernal Sales Benefits. Your opponent may take 1 card into his Hand, taken from the top of any patent deck.
Your allied opponent has a Bernal at LTO (Low Titan Orbit), with a dirtside at ontario lacus (Spectral Type D). This Factory is connected to kraken mare (Spectral Type V), which is unclaimed. You have produced a V Black-Side refinery, and ask your opponent to pay you an Aqua if you bring this card to LTO for sale. She accepts. Because you are allies, she must accept the sale, and she is not allowed to renege on the 1 Aqua payment since the payment is not in the future (but rather in the turn of delivery). You get 9 Aqua from the Pool. For her benefit, she takes a card from the radiator patent deck. On her turn, she industrializes kraken mare, which becomes a new Dirtside. The no snow rule prevents you from selling any more V cards to her Bernal.
3B5. Isotope Monetization (Module 1)
In Module 1, gold beads representing starship isotope fuel can be factory-refueled (1C1a) at factories matching the Spectral Type of your GW thruster, should you have one. This is called your iso-standard. In Module 3, the first gold bead produced doubles the costs of FINAO for all players, and gold beads stored at your Bank (3A3j) can be used as currency for auctions or FINAO:14 Gold beads at your Bank are worth 10 Aqua
a. 2X FINAO Costs. Failure Is Not An Option (H7e) costs are instantly and permanently doubled for all players
(including those with Open Source faction privilege) if one of these occurs:
• Either the Lofstrom Loop (2B4f) or the GEO Space Elevator (2B4i) is Anchored as a Home Bernal.
• The first gold bead of isotope fuel is produced (1C1a).
• The first ET Home Bernal (3F1) is Anchored
EASILY MISSED (Module 1): You may not produce isotope FTs without having a GW thruster in space that specifies the Spectral Type (1Cb). [3B5]
14SPONTANEOUS MONETIZATION OF ISOTOPES. Inflation is caused by increases in the quantity of money. As water becomes more plentiful, prices using water currency become inflated. Perhaps the programmers would start charging 6 Aquas instead of 4 for FINAO. An industrialist with his wealth stored in a water depot would see his wealth diminish daily. In order to preserve his savings for future projects, he would join the growing demand for an inflation hedge. Once enough people want to own isotopes as a robust store of value and thus are willing to accept them in exchange for their own goods and services, others become willing to accept them too, even those with no savings and thus no need of an inflation hedge. At some point, isotopes become money that is universally acceptable.

Ñòðàíèöà 11

b. Blue/Gold Bead Exchange Rate. At your Bank, one gold bead can be exchanged for 10 Aqua, and vice versa. Thus, if you pay the programmers with 1 gold bead, you get 2 Aqua in return.
You have a mini-mag orion that you wish to take through a Hazard and need to pay the programmers. You isotope refuel one gold bead at your M Factory, and transport this by Freighter to an opponent’s Bernal. First you negotiate and pay a small fee in Aqua. Then you use his Bernal as a bank to pay the programmers 1 gold bead, and receive 2 Aqua in change. There happens to be a War going on, but you are Player Gray, and your extremist delegate automatically evades the War restrictions on FINAO.
c. Gold Bead Bank Transactions. If your Bank receives any gold beads in a transaction, either through negotiation or in an auction, as soon as they leave the Bank they automatically become your iso-standard.
d. Debasement. If you never had a GW/TW thruster and thus no iso-standard, you cannot hold any gold beads. If your Bank receives an Isotope in trade you must immediately convert it into Aqua.
e. Iso-Standard Permanency. Once you have established your iso-standard, it can be changed only if you buy a new GW/TW thruster after selling or losing your original GW/TW thruster.
3C. War Of Independence Outbreak
As the game progresses, Factory stock prices will decrease, increasing the chance of the War of Independence (War). There are 2 ways that the War can start: By rolling high in a war outbreak roll (3C1) or by completing a casus belli Future (1D2c, 3C2). See 3C3 for immediate effects
a. One War Only. War outbreak will never happen again once one bloc or the other has won the War (3F4a).
b. Determine Your Bloc. During the first War/Anarchy, Players Purple, Yellow, and White start as Loyalists (M), while Players Green, Gray, and Red start as Independents (B).15 This bloc can change as a result of losing a battle (3B3a) or defection (3B3c).
c. Allies and Enemies. If you are a Loyalist, during War/Anarchy all other Loyalists are allies and all Independents are enemies. It’s the other way around if you are an Independent. Your Crew is always your ally.
d. War Effects (3D) are enacted starting with the next player’s Turn, and last until the War ends per 3F4.
e. Abilities. If a card Ability or a rule outside this Module says “during Anarchy”, this means ”during War” as well
15 ASTROLOGICAL SYMBOLS used for Earth (m) and Sol (b) also signify the Loyalist and Independence Blocs respectively. These icons were codified during the Renaissance for zodiac cults, and are still used in the science of astronomy. Using the sun icon b as an icon for liberation furthers the heliocentric revolution started by Copernicus, which dethrones the Earth as the center of the universe.
EASILY MISSED: The term 'opponent' in these rules is used to define all other players, not allies or enemies. [3Cc]

Ñòðàíèöà 12

3C1. War Outbreak Roll (adds to the Industrialization Operation)
Assuming the War of Independence has not yet occurred, or during a truce (3F3), each time that an Exploitation Track is adjusted because a new Factory is built during industrialization (I7), roll one dice (1d6) and add the number of Seniority Disks that have been placed into the assembly (O6). If the result is greater than the (unmodified) stock value in that category, then there is an outbreak of War at the end of that player’s Turn.16
After Turn 36, there are 3 Seniority Disks in the political assembly. You build the first factory on an M asteroid. The stock price on the M column drops to 8, and you make a war outbreak roll. You roll “6”, plus 3 = 9. War is declared!
3C2. Casus Belli Outbreak (Modules 1 & 2 Futures)
Assuming it has not yet occurred, War starts by the successful completion of a casus belli Future (1D2c), including secession (1D5e), footfall (1D5e), pan sapiens (1D5e), and robot emancipation by uplift (1D5e).
a. If a 2nd Casus Belli is Completed, points are still scored but do not trigger War.
EASILY MISSED (Module 2): A war outbreak roll is not made if the Exploitation Track is adjusted by a Mobile Factory landing on a Claim. [3C1]
3C3. What Happens If War/Anarchy Breaks Out?
If either the outbreak of War occurs, or the Anarchy event (K2e) is rolled, 3 effects (3C3a,b,c) happen immediately, and war effects (3D) start at the end of the Turn. If Anarchy occurs during War, nothing happens except for the Purge Roll, and combat becomes optional.
a. Bloc Assignment. The players are separated into the Independence and Loyalist blocs, according to the propaganda of their color. Assuming no defections have occurred, Players Green, Gray, and Red are Independence, and Players Purple, Yellow, and White are Loyalists.17
16 TIPPING POINT. The war trigger in this game depends upon the establishment of multiple factories of the same Spectral Type. This implies both a trade war for the Earth market, and an establishment of an internal market in space. If one of the competitors in the trade war uses Earth-based regulations or taxation to gain a competitive advantage, this could be a basis for hostilities. Such defiance is sustainable only if the income from internal trade rivals that from imports and exports to Earth. This point, called the tipping point (hat tip to Andy Doull), heralds the financial independence of the colonies.
17BLOC ASSIGNMENT follows logically from ideology. Freedom and individuality favor self-reliance and a can-do attitude, and respect independence as a virtue. Unity and authority favor community, comradeship, and patriotism and respect loyalty (often in a military chain of command) as a virtue. Equality and honor were not so obvious, and I had trouble deciding which bloc to put them into.

Ñòðàíèöà 13

b. Remove Star Token. Move the Active Law star into the War/Anarchy slot (yellow star) on the political assembly. This indicates Laws cannot be made active or lobbied.
c. Purge Roll (K1e). The 1st Player rolls one dice (1d6) and consults the dice numbers printed on the assembly. Decommission (if possible) one delegate of each player color in this Ideology. Extremists are immune!
d. Delegates. If any player has a delegate in an enemy bloc, by the end of his Turn he must either (1) suborn it by placing a bribe under it (3D2b), or (2) Decommission it. Player White's delegates cannot be corrupted. (3D6c).
e. Unanchor Independence Bernals (Module 2). If any Independence player has a Home Bernal, by the end of his Turn he must either (1) evade the “No Home Bernal Anchor” restriction (with a petition in authority), or (2) it is unanchored.18 Furthermore, a Bernal without any allied Dirtsides (i.e. all of its Dirtside Factory cubes belong to the enemy), is similarly unanchored (3E9a).
f. Desertion of Enemy Colonists (Module 2). The faction Ideology (B6b) of each Colonist determines which bloc the Colonist is allied with (checking the propaganda in its Ideology). If at the end of your Turn you are in one bloc, and a Colonist of yours supports the other bloc, you must either (1) evade the “No Enemy Colonists” restriction (3D5d honor), or (2) Discard this enemy Colonist to the bottom of the queue
• Instances of Desertion. This can happen during War/Anarchy outbreak (3C3e), whenever the Colonist’s propaganda is flipped (3B3a,b,c), or if you defect (3B3c).
• Exomigration. If a Colonist deserts during your Turn, exomigration occurs on your following Turn.
3C4. What Is the Difference Between War & Anarchy?
Anarchy is an event (K2e) that lasts only as long as Season Blue, and combat is never mandatory. War can end in truce (3F3) or victory (3F4). But otherwise, all Anarchy rules are applicable during War as well:
a. Both move the Active Law (star token) into the War/Anarchy spot in the political assembly (3C3b).
EASILY MISSED: Suborn (3D2b) is a once-per-turn free action, so you can only save one of your delegates in enemy ideologies. [3C3d]
EASILY MISSED (Module 2): If unanchored, do not forget dirt-refuel per 3E9a. [3C3e]
TIP (Module 2): If you are Independence and have a Home Bernal, keep a spare generator in your Bernal Stack, so that you will be able to travel to a better location in case of War. Furthermore, if your Colonist is a Loyalist, remember that they will desert (3C3f). Perhaps send them on a risky assignment, if their replacements are more trustworthy. [3C3e]
EASILY MISSED: You are always allied with your Crew (3Cc). [3C3f]
18INDEPENDENCE HOME BERNALS. Suppose an entrepreneur makes his living selling beamed energy from a powersat Home Bernal to customers on Earth. Unfortunately, War breaks out, and the entrepreneur has known Independence sympathies. What happens? Let’s assume the owner has de facto control over the space station. This means, even if one or more nations claim it as their own property, this has little effect without a boatload of marines. And a direct assault is complicated by the fact that beamed energy has obvious defensive force. On the other hand, the owner is unlikely to risk the lives of his workers, and his expensive property, by taking offensive measures of his own. Both he and his customers will want to continue business as usual, yet the customers will be under pressure, perhaps fines, seizures, imprisonment, to find more expensive energy elsewhere. The net result may be that the Bernal will uproot and move out of Earth orbit, using its own dirt shield as propellant. The empty shell is uninhabitable during its journey to a new home

b. Both start with a Purge Roll (K2e)
c. Both limit some Operations and free actions by war/anarchy restrictions (3D4, 3D5). 19
d. Both forgo Discarding Colonists during unanchoring (3A3g).
e. Both allow Felonies and combat against an enemy, vendettas (3D1), corruption & suborning (3D2), and dislodging (3D7).
f. Both disable faction privileges (B6a), and enable faction weapons (3D6).
3D. War or Anarchy
War divides the players into two blocs (3B2c), your allies and your enemies. War features restrictions (3D4, 3D5) on boosting, free market sales, initiating research auctions, entering LEO, FINAO, promoting, retaining Colonists, exomigration, homesteading, and remaining in a Home Bernal anchorage.
a. Combat & Felonies are allowed between enemies during both War and Anarchy
] You want to prospect Luna, but unfortunately the 1st Player does not give her permission. Prospecting without her permission is a Felony and only allowed if you are allowed Felonies. Then War breaks out, and you and her are enemies (she is a Loyalist scum!). In War, you are allowed Felonies against enemies, and so do not need her permission. But suppose you and her are allies. Now you still need her permission. Perhaps she will accept a bribe in return for permission!
EASILY MISSED: “Opponent” and “enemy” are not the same. “Opponent” means another player. “Enemy” means another player who is also of the opposed bloc during War (e.g. he is Loyalist, but you are Independence). [3D]
3D1. Vendetta (War/Anarchy Only)
A vendetta is an action forbidden by exoplanetary law. You can perform one only by paying your victim a bribe just before the relevant dice roll (just after in the case of sabotage). There are 5 kinds of vendettas: sneak attack, sabotage, Human kamikaze, gray goo, and dropstone:
EASILY MISSED: Felonies are not vendettas and never require a bribe. [3D1]
EASILY MISSED: Biological warheads and amat bombs are not vendettas. [3D1]
19TYRANNY OF THE ROCKET EQUATION. In space, the economy of both war and peace is dominated by transportation costs in which it is normal to pour 99% of the vehicular energy into the propellant, where it flies uselessly into space at high speed, and only 1% to actually move the space vehicle. Why do they voluntarily make such a lopsided partition of energy? Because in space, where every gram matters, the fuel economy is improved by ejecting it at high energy. All vehicles need both energy and mass to maneuver. On Earth, everyone worries about energy (e.g. how much fuel remains), but the mass is taken for granted. In this game, the fuel is taken for granted, but the mass (propellant) is carefully tracked. The tyranny of the rocket equation means that rockets are extremely fragile in warfare: with feeble thrusting, high energies which cannot be cloaked, big cryotanks that can’t be armored, and components so frail as to not be able to support their own weight if they sat on Earth.
