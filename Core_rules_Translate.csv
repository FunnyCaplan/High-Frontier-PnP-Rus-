A1. Core Overview;ј1.  раткий обзор основной игры
Players, representing the spacefaring factions of Earth, bid for patents (space technology cards) and boost them into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to be assembled into Rockets and their Cargos. Water in LEO is used both as commodity currency and as rocket propellant, and each water container there is called one Aqua. Once loaded with Fuel Tanks (FTs) of water, Rockets fly to promising industrial and science Sites (planets, asteroids, etc.). If prospecting succeeds, a Claim is made. A Claim can be upgraded to a Factory to produce useful new equipment. By extracting water from a Site, FTs are produced both for water propellant and as money (УAquaФ) if shipped back to LEO.;»гроки, представл€ющие космические фракции «емли, вкладывают деньги в патенты и изобретени€ (карты космических технологий), затем отправл€ют их на низкую околоземную орбиту (Ќќќ), чтобы собрать из них ракеты и их грузы. ¬ода на Ќќќ используетс€ как в качестве торговой валюты, так и в качестве ракетного топлива, и каждый бак с водой там называетс€ Aqua. ѕосле загрузки “опливных Ѕаков (“Ѕ) с водой –акеты лет€т к перспективным дл€ производства и исследований ќбъектам (планетам, астероидам и т. д.). ≈сли поиск оказываетс€ успешным, подаетс€ Claim.

A3. Introductory Games;
Space Diamonds introduces the map and moving, Starship Builder (at the end of the Space Diamonds book) introduces the cards, and Race For Glory introduces the core rules prescribed here using a detailed tutorial, with the exception of Radiation Belts (H10), supports (J), & events (D2).;
;
1 WATER, THE KEY TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM. No place in space has resource value without a local supply of water, primarily for rocket propellant and УexofuelsФ, but also for chemical and mineralogical processing, dust control, crops, and life support. Water is a storable and convenient source of hydrogen, the superior propellant for thermodynamic rockets. Water is a natural shield against energetic protons, kilo for kilo better than regolith or even metals. Finally, without recycling, each man-year requires 10 tonnes of water. (Although it is worth noting that human metabolisms convert carbohydrates plus oxygen into carbon dioxide and water, thus we are stoichiometrically net producers rather than consumers of water.)

B. Components & Anatomies;
B1. Component List See УRead Me FirstФ.;
B2. Patent Cards;
The 6 types of patent cards in core game are: thrusters (rocket engines), robonauts (remotely-powered mining machines), refineries (ore purifiers), generators (producers of pulsed or steady current), reactors (producers of 3 kinds of radiation energy), and radiators (providers of cooling Therms).;
"a. White & Black-Sides. The White-Side of a patent card shows a product built on Earth; the Black-Side shows an improved product built in space. Until you build your first Factory on a Site, you will only be using the White-Side of the patent cards.";
b.Mass. Listed in the upper left corner, chiefly used to determine its boost costs and its contribution to the Dry Mass on the Fuel Strip.;
c. Platform & ISRU. Cards that have an In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) rating inside a platform icon can be used to ISRU refuel (I5a) and prospect (I6).2;
d. Thrust Triangle. Cards with a thrust triangle (H2) are capable of moving Stacks. The number on a thrust triangleТs left side is its base thrust and the number on its right side is its fuel consumption. The color of the triangle indicates its fuel grade (F4b). If it has a flame icon at its apex, it can afterburn (H3a). If instead of a dot icon, it has a push icon in its lower center, it is pushable (H3d).;
e. Solar-Power indicates a modification to thrust based upon how far from Sol the Spacecraft is located (H3c). It is separate and independent from all other numbers and icons in the thrust triangle or on the thruster itself. These modifiers apply only if the card is part of the support chain ( J1c) for an activated thrust triangle. A Solar-Powered Card becomes non-operational (J2) if in the Neptune J Heliocentric Zone or beyond ( J3a).;
f. Spectral Type. The letter shown on the Black-Side of a patent (C, S, M, V, D, or H), and previewed on the front side, indicates what type of Factory can build it as an ET product (I8).3;
;
2 WATER AVAILABILITY is greatest on worlds with icy cores, where simply injecting steam into a wellhole produces water. On drier worlds, where water only occurs as tiny ice crystals or hydrated silicates, the regolith would need to be crushed, sealed in a vessel at 1 atm, and cooked to 700 K to extract water as vapor. The vapor is then liquified by cooling to 280 K and separating solids and gases. The liquid water (some of which is recycled to the first step) is degassed briefly in a vacuum to remove dissolved gasses, and placed in storage. Assuming 4% water content in 70% of the top 2 meters of regolith, four tonnes of regolith must be scavenged to obtain 120 kg/day of water. In one year, one game FT is extracted from an excavated area of about 1100 m2 (about 24 X 24 meters). ЧLewis et al., Resources of Near-Earth Space, 1993.;
3 SPECTRAL TYPE is the asteroidal composition as measured by spectral reflectivity. The gameТs spectral types are: C = Уcarbonaceous chondriteФ. The most common asteroid type in the inner solar system, marked by coal black deposits of fluffy graphite and tarlike organics. Up to 20% water as hydrides. Some may have ice cores.;
D = Уdark kerogensФ. The most common asteroid type in the outer solar system, presumed dormant comets with reddish-black organics and pyroxene.;
H = Уhelium-3Ф. A rare isotope of helium found in gas giants and SWIV (solar wind implanted volatiles), essential for clean aneutronic fusion.;
M = Уmetalliferous ironФ. These are presumed to be the iron-nickel core of an unresolved planet. The Fe-Ni kamacites are very tough at daytime temperatures, but at night undergo a ductile-to-brittle transition that makes them easy to crush. Little carbon. Included with type M is the rare type E (enstatite, a titanium alloy) and type W (Уwet metalliferousФ, with hydrated silicates). An example on the map of type E is Nysa, and of type W is Hertha, both in the Nysa family.;
S = Уstony chondriteФ. Silicates, sulfides, metals, and possible uranium and thorium fission fuels. However, little carbon or water. Most NEAs (Near Earth Asteroids) are of this type.;
V = УvestoidФ. These bright worlds contain howardites, eucrites, diogenites, and metals, but little carbon or hydrogen.;

h. Support Cards Required to make the card Operational (J1) are listed here. The example data field shown requires one Therm of cooling (J1d).;
i. Wrench Icons indicate movement-modifying supports ( J5). These modifiers apply only if the card is part of the support chain ( J1c) for an activated thrust triangle.;
j. Rad-Hardness. Resistance to solar flares ( K2d), and Radiation Belts ( H10).4;
k. Support Provided. Icons in the top left indicate which supports a card provides (J).;
;
B3. Glory & Heroism Chits;
The 9 glory chits, placed on the map per C7, are worth 1 VP each when claimed by a Human plus variable VP if brought back to LEO/Bank by a Human (L). Each of the 4 Heroism Chits are always worth 2 VP. Both are shown in example A2a.;
;
B4. Playmats;
Each player starts with a playmat for storing their cards and Aquas (the blue beads stored in your LEO Stack, used for money and fueling).5 It contains a Fuel Strip and net thrust track (used to keep track of the Fuel and net thrust of their Rocket Stack).6;
;
Net thrust track;
Fuel strip;
Cards in these locations are called stacks;
ROCKET When patent cards are put into this slot, place a Rocket gure on the appropriate map location.;
LEO Fuel Tanks in LEO are called Aquas. Aquas function as both Fuel Tanks and currency. Store Glories and Aquas in LEO in designated areas.;
OUTPOST 1 When patent cards are placed into an outpost, put the outpost 1 chit on the appropriate map location.;
OUTPOST 2 When patent cards are placed into an outpost, put the outpost 2 chit on the appropriate map location.;
FUEL STRIP KEY X Dry & Wet Mass chit location. X Wet Mass chit location only. X Fuel consumption interval between locations. For example, going from 5 to 2 uses 13 steps of Fuel (3+4+6). Aid used to calculate Required Wet Mass only. No game e ect.;
MANAGE DRY AND WET MASS Dry Mass = sum of card & cargo Masses. Wet Mass = Dry Mass + Mass of Fuel added. Add Fuel: Move Wet Mass chit one step right along for each FT added. If Jettisoning Fuel, move Wet Mass chit as many steps as desired left along . Expend Fuel: At each Burn, move Wet Mass chit left along a number of steps = fuel consumption. Dry Mass Modi cation: Move both chits right (adding) or left (removing) along . Never against an arrow.;
CALCULATE REQUIRED FUEL A simple way to calculate Required Wet Mass to reach a destination is with intervals, as follows: Required Burns x fuel consumption = steps. From Dry Mass, move right following intervals X. Sum all X until ? steps. If greater, follow left, subtracting 1 for each step until sum = steps. Final location is Required Wet Mass.;
Net Thrust track | Place Rocket gure to indicate net thrust. Thrust modi ed by afterburn ( ), weight class, solar power ( ) and beamed power ( );
;
4 RAD-HARDNESS is rated on the accumulated dosage of environmental radiation a piece of equipment can survive, as measured in krad (Si). 1 krad (Si) = 10 J/kg of silicon. The chief radiation hazards are high energy protons from CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) and radiation belts (electrons & gammas are more easily shielded). Both sources of protons increase 1000X after a major solar event. Electronics and photovoltaic cells are particularly affected. Because shielding beyond a centimeter of aluminum has little effect, the rad-hardness of electronics is improved by using circuits that do not readily latch-up or upset, and guarded by error-correcting and watchdog timers. Such circuits include Radiation Hard CMOS and AsGa circuits, with rad-hardness 5 (about a Mrad).;
5 AQUAS are 40 tonne tanks of water propellant orbiting in LEO. Boosting out of EarthТs 9.5 km/sec gravity well puts orbital water at the same price per kilo as gold! The Russian Proton boosts at $4000/kg, and the Shuttle boosted at $10,000/kg. For half the delta-v (required change in spacecraft velocity), a rocket tanker can haul ISRU water to LEO from the martian moons or NEAs (Near Earth Asteroids). Water is valuable in LEO, which is drier than the Sahara. People get thirsty, but at least human water needs can be recycled. A rocket is far more thirsty than 100 people, and the water it consumes is lost forever.;
"6 ROCKET SCIENCE mainly concerns getting propellant to intercept fuel energy efficiently. This energy is usually radiation and energetic particles from chemical or nuclear reactions. Lines and windows characterize the opacity of a propellant across a radiation spectrum; lines are where the radiation is absorbed and windows are where the radiation gets through. Dirty reactions are those that generate products that are not easily absorbed by water or hydrogen propellant. This deals a double whammy: not only is escaping radiation wasted, but it also creates waste heat that must be rejected by radiators (other than radiation passing directly into space; for instance, half of proton-antiproton energy escapes via neutrinos). Examples of dirty reactions are high neutron fission, D-T fusion, and antimatter reactions. Clean reactions include chemical rockets and aneutronic fusion like 3He-D and H-B.";

B5. Solar System Charts;
The six Exploitation Tracks (showing Spectral Types C, S, M, V, D, and H) are found on the map. There are two placards: Sol Sunspot Cycle and Sol political assembly (O1).;
;
B6. Crew Cards;
Your Crew has a player color, Mass, ISRU platform, rad-hardness, a thrust triangle, and a Уhumans on boardФ triangle. The latter means it is Human (see glossary). A Crew is useful to defend against Felonies or repair Glitches. All rules about Humans apply to stacks where the card is located. It cannot be traded, sold, or Discarded (but see N3d).;
a. Faction Privilege. This Ability, listed below the rad-hardness, is active in the core game except during Anarchy (K2e). They include Blink Telescope, Dharma Refuel, Felonious, Launch Fees, Marketeer, Mooncable, Open Source FINAO, Powersat, Secretary-General, Scrum Troubleshooters, Skunkworks, and Taxes (see glossary). All faction privileges are assumed to be the result of space facilities in LEO. If Module 2 is used, these space facilities are Home Bernals, and faction privileges are disabled until this space station is Anchored in a Home Orbit.;
b. Faction Ideology. (Module 0). Used for placing delegates (O2c).;
;
B7. Solar System Map;
The map shows the Spaces (i.e. the orbits in the Solar System where a Rocket can УhaltФ), and the routes between the Spaces.7 Some of the most useful routes are colored and labeled with signposts (e.g. УEarth-MarsФ). The various kinds of Spaces are described below:;
a. Sites. Black hexes representing areas of planets, moons, and asteroids that can be landed on. Site features include:;
Х Size is a number indicating the surface gravity--the larger the number the more likely prospecting will be successful but the more powerful your Rocket has to be to takeoff/land there.;
Х Spectral Type (C, S, M, V, D, or H) indicates what can be mined and factory-produced there;
Х Atmospheric Site is indicated by the cloud icon in the Site hex.;
Х Hydration (zero to four waterdrops) indicates how easy it is to obtain water there.8;
Х Astrobiology Site is indicated by the leaf icon.;
Х  Submarine Site is indicated by the blue wave icon.9 A Factory or Colony here is in a subsurface ocean. ;
Push Site is indicated by the push icon . A Factory here yields the Powersat Ability.;
;
7 THE HIGH FRONTIER MAP divides space into two topographies: circumplanetary lander burns (steep gravity wells around planets), and interplanetary Hohmanns (shallow heliocentric gravity fields). It scales to energy, not distance! Note that each Space represents a stable orbit, so rockets do not УdriftФ. To change orbits, you must achieve a Уvelocity incrementФ that costs mass and energy.;
8 HYDRATION. For worlds in the Jupiter zone and beyond, surface ice is common since it wonТt sublimate if shielded from solar heat. Some of the larger outer worlds, like Ceres, Ganymede, and Europa, have polar ice caps and may have subterranean oceans. The D-type asteroids, common in the Trojans and other outer reaches, have never been hot enough to chemically bind their water to minerals, and their water may be still be sequestered as primal icy cores. Closer in, solar heat has bound the water of C- and W-types into hydrated silicates and clays. (Hertha and Lutetia are actually W-type, and not M-type as stated on the map.) A few main-belt УasteroidsФ are active comets like 133P/Elst-Pizarro. These must have lost their surface volatiles long ago, but were УrevivedФ by recent collisions that exposed buried ices. M-, S-, and V-types are drier, but the larger ones may have primeval water protected by a permafrost layer. The moons of Earth and Mars, while anhydrous on the surface, may have buried ice crystals in the polar regions, or in places impacted by aqueous comets or asteroids. Missions such as the 2009 LCROSS impactor suggest water ice lies in the south lunar pole. One can find ice even on Mercury, in permanent shadows on the north pole.;
9 SUBSURFACE OCEANS. Some icy worlds may have liquid water underneath the ice, heated by radioactivity or tidal kneading. Pockets of volcanic gases floating in the water under the ice may be suitable places to establish submarine bases.;
;
—траница 7;
;
b. Intersections. The intersection between two routes is a Space called a Hohmann if the two lines touch or form a corner unmarked by any icon or circle.10 This includes each corner in the zigzag routes such as those common in the outer solar system.;
Х Lagrange & Lander Spaces. A Space is not a Hohmann if it is marked by any icon (e.g. a hollow or filled circle or lander icon).11;
Х Bridges. If the lines donТt touch, they do not intersect and are therefore neither a Space nor a Hohmann intersection.;
Х Changing direction during movement at a Hohmann requires a Pivot (H4c).;
Х Home Orbits. The Home Orbits for Bernals are marked with a 7-pointed star icon.;
;
c. Burn Spaces. These Spaces are magenta-colored on the map. There are two types: Lagrange Burns and lander burns (H5e).12 Each time a Rocket enters a Burn Space, it must expend a number of fuel steps equal to its fuel consumption.;
d. Spaces may also be marked with Hazard (H7), flyby (H8), or Radiation Belt ( H10) icons.;
e. Aerobrake Path is a route with a dashed brown line. Using this path, a Spacecraft can parachute to a Site by ignoring net thrust requirements and without using Fuel. Entering an Aerobrake Hazard requires either a Hazard Roll or FINAO payment (H7e). A Spacecraft can never move along this path against the arrowТs direction.13;
f. Buggy Road is a route with a dashed yellow line. It is used during buggy prospecting, but can also be used to move Crew (H9a).;
TIP: Many Lagrange intersections are labeled (L1, barycenter, cycler, etc.). These labels have no gameplay impact. [B7b];
TIP: The majority of Burn Spaces are either around planets or at the outer edge of each Heliocentric Zone. Closer to the sun, there are routes through the edges of Heliocentric Zones which donТt have Burn Spaces, representing the Interplanetary Travel Network. Use these to trade fuel consumption for time. [B7c];
;
10 HOHMANN TRANSFER. If a rocket in a circular orbit makes an impulsive thrust in any direction, it flies into an elliptical orbit. By thrusting again at the extreme limit (periapsis or apoapsis) of this ellipse, it can enter a destination orbit either higher (superior) or lower (inferior) than its starting one. This elliptical route, requiring a high thrust at each end and a lot of coasting in-between, is called a Hohmann transfer. The Hohmann is usually the trajectory requiring the lowest delta-v to reach a destination orbit. The routes on the map are modeled on Hohmann ellipses. The Hohmann requires that the destination and embarkation bodies be close to opposition (at opposite sides of Sol). Therefore, the launch windows for a Hohmann can be considerable, varying from 3.5 months for Earth-Mercury, to just under 6 years for Earth-Saturn. The Hohmann transfer is illustrated in the Appendix (W3.Q5).;
11 LAGRANGE POINTS. In any two-world orbital system (like the Earth-Luna system shown), there are five points where very little or no energy is required for a spacecraft to maintain formation with both worlds. These points, called Lagrange Points, are denoted L1 through L5. They are analogous to GEO in that they allow a satellite to be in a УfixedФ position, with no Уlaunch windowsФ within the system. Even more significant, Lagrange Points are embarkation spots for the Interplanetary Transit Network. Of the five points, L4 and L5 are the only stable ones.;
12 BURN SPACES show the velocity increment required to travel between orbits, often called delta-v. Each game Burn is 2.5 km/sec of delta-v. The delta-v of a rocket is defined by the rocket equation: Delta-v = Ve ln (Wet Mass/Dry Mass), where Ve is the exit velocity of the propellant in km/sec. Assuming a minimum energy (Hohmann) transfer, the delta-v to fly from LEO to some nearby destinations is: Nereus = 4.5 km/sec, Venus capture = 5.5 km/sec (neglecting aerobrake), Phobos/Deimos = 5.6 km/sec, lunar base = 5.7 km/sec, EarthТs surface = 9.5 km/sec, and Mars base = 10.2 km/sec (again assuming no aerobraking). Notice that the martian moons are closer to us than our own moon, in terms of fuel and energy.;
13 AEROBRAKE. A spacecraft can lose approach velocity and enter a capture HEO by making a close aerobrake pass through the atmosphere. Repeated atmospheric passes at the low (periapsis) point circularizes the HEO into a low circular orbit. Any solar panels and radiators will need thermal protection, possibly using foamed ceramic heat shields fabricated from asteroidal rocks.;

;
g. Heliocentric Zones divide the solar system into concentric circles to mark the decreasing solar energy as you move farther away from Sol. Each zone is named after a planet (from Mercury D to Neptune J). These zones modify the thrust of Solar-Powered Rockets and Sails (H3c). Solar-Powered Cards are not Operational in the outermost zone.;
h. Synodic Comet Site. A Site with a red, blue, or yellow border, which represents a comet whose extreme orbit causes it to become accessible only during the season of the Sunspot Cycle matching its border color.14 See glossary for details.;
i. Signposts & Colored Lines. These have no impact on gameplay and are merely informational. They highlight a possible route to the depicted location and list the number of Burn Spaces to the destination, assuming no Pivots (H4c) and using flybys (H8). The number of Burns, multiplied by your fuel consumption (B2d), equals the fuel steps you will need for a one-way trip.;
"j. Glory Setup. Circles labeled УgloryФ or ""heroism"" start with a glory or heroism chit (C7).";
k. Map Text is merely descriptive except for some printed rules at the kreutz sungrazer (B7h), Venus flyby (H8c), solar oberth (H8e) and Luna (I6).;
l. Map Locator. A clockface is depicted around Sol as a Site locator, in conjunction with the Heliocentric astronomical icons. For instance, Earth/LEO is located at 3:30 M.;

14 SYNODIC COMET is a world with a high inclination (>10∞), which brings it well out of the plane in which most of the solar system orbits. It also has a much higher eccentricity (>0.5), contrasting its oblong orbit with the mostly circular orbits of the other sites. The capture delta-v of a synodic comet is sensitive to the point in the orbit that you attempt to enter it (i.e. short entry window). The delta-v for exit must be installed as a small fraction of the orbital period, implying high accelerations (and short exit windows as well). In game terms, synodic comets are accessible but once every dozen years or so, and have additional Burns for orbit matching (calculated using EdelbaumТs Equation and Shoemaker Tables). Except for HalleyТs (and beyond), all worlds are shown at their proportional semi-major axis from Sol.;

;
C. Core Setup;
The number of players can be from 2 to 5 (or 1 in some scenarios). Before starting, decide on any Modules or variants (separate booklet). Note the quick start game (V1) (recommended for 4 or more players), the Space Diamonds chit variant (iA), and the solitaire/cooperative variant (V4).;
C1. Seniority Disk Placement;
Use the УCORE GAMEФ side of the Sol Sunspot Cycle placard. Place 4 translucent red disks in the center (over the Sol icon).15 These will count the gameТs solar cycles, so one disk will be removed each time the seniority threshold is crossed, indicating the completion of one 12-year cycle.16;
C2. Assign Factions & Crew;
Deal each player a random Crew, then each player secretly chooses one side of the card that they will play as.;
;
15 SENIORITY. Each player represents a genius visionary, and the seniority disks measure his/her lifespan. To get your age in Earth years, add 10. For example, on Turn 46 you are 56 years old. The plot of the game is to accomplish as much as possible before you die on the final seniority threshold;
16 THE SOLAR CYCLE of our sun ranges from minimal sunspots and storm activity to maximum in about 11-years. Solar storms often emit flares, a burst of radiation across the spectrum, that triggers radio blackouts and storms in the magnetospheres of planets throughout the solar system. The power density in the x-ray region determines the flare category: B, C, M, or X. The X-class flares are the biggest, endangering space electronics, solar cells, and astronauts (who have about 15 minutes to get into their storm shelters). Solar storms also emit expanding blobs of particles called Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Being particles rather than radiation, CMEs are rather localized, and propagate slower (1 to 4 days to reach 1 AU), but they can pack more punch when they hit.;
;
PLAYER GRAY: There are no gray components pro vided for Norse Astronauts/ SpaceX. If you wish to play with one of these Factions, you must use components from an unused Faction color. These components are considered gray in color for all purposes, including starting delegate (O1b). [C2];

C3. Reserves Setup;
Each player takes a playmat and places their Crew into the slot labeled УLEOФ with the chosen Faction faceup. Near their playmat, they place the following components in their player color in their Reserve: a. 2 Rockets (one for map, one to indicate net thrust). b. 1 Dry Mass Chit and 1 blue/gray Wet Mass Chit for their fuel strip. c. 7 small cubes (for Factories). d. 7 domes (for Colonies). e. 9 disks (for Claims). f. 2 rectangular chits (for Outpost Stacks);
C4. Patent Deck Setup;
Separately shuffle each of the six decks of patent cards (thruster, robonaut, refinery, generator, reactor, radiator), and place them White-Side up near the map.;
C5. Starting Aquas;
Give each player as many blue Aqua beads as there are patent decks (but not queues) in the game. In the core game, this is 6 Aquas, placed into the LEO slot on their playmat.17 If quick start (V1) is used, start with zero Aqua.;
C6. Exploitation Track Setup;
Place a blue bead on each of the 6 starting positions of the Exploitation Tracks on the map.;
C7. Glory & Heroism Chit Setup;
Place 1 glory chit on each Heliocentric Zone in the spots marked with the corresponding astronomical icon: Mercury (D), Venus (C), Earth (M), Mars (E), Ceres (K), Jupiter (F), Saturn (G), Uranus (H), and Neptune (J) (B7j). Place all glories with their У1 VPФ side faceup. Unless playing solitaire or 2-player, place 1 УheroismФ chit in each of the 4 Heroism spots (medallions) in the lower center of the map.;
C8. Clout, 1st Player, & Sunspot Cube;
Every Crew card has a rating from A to M, where УAФ has the most clout (political influence).;
a. 1st Player. The player with the most clout becomes the УSol secretary-generalФ (1st Player).;
b. Sunspot Cube. The 1st Player places a cube of his color (the Sunspot Cube) on the УstartФ position of the Sunspot Cycle, and then starts the game by taking his Turn (D1).;
WATER-BASED CURRENCY. The discovery of the California goldfields in 1848 led to gold being abundant relative to local commodities. For instance, a single egg could cost 1 gold dollar, containing one-twentieth of an ounce of gold. Thus it was cheaper to buy almost everything outside of California, leading to gold rapidly finding its way to other states and other lands. The same would happen in a water-based currency if water was discovered on Luna. In an exchange market in LEO, where water is in extreme demand for outgoing rockets, lunar water would need only two Burns to import (delta-v = 5 km/sec), half that of water boosted from Earth (10 km/sec).;

. Yearly Play Sequence;
After Setup, High Frontier proceeds as a series of years. Each year consists of:;
a. Player Turns. Starting with the 1st Player and going clockwise, each player takes one Turn (D1).;
b. Sunspot Cycle Advance. If a threshold is crossed, see (D2a,b).;
A pad explosion is rolled. The 1st player has two Mass 3 cards in his LEO Stack and chooses one to Decommission. Then, the other players in clockwise order pick one of their heaviest LEO cards to Decommission.;

In this phase, each of the players takes a Turn. You may do either or both of the following on your Turn, in any order: move your Rocket and/or perform an Operation. Except during movement or an Operation, you may perform any number of free actions.;
a. Movement (H). You may move your Rocket once per Turn. Some Modules allow multiple Spacecraft, and if so, you may move each of them once per Turn.;
b. Operation (I). You may perform one Operation per Turn.;
c. Free Actions (G). You may perform any number of free actions on your Turn, including the same free action multiple times.;
TYPICAL TURN: ET Produce a Black-Side Card at Factory (operation). Place Black-Side Card at Outpost at same location. Land Rocket at Outpost (move). Cargo transfer to add Black-Side Card to Rocket (free action). [D1];
D2. Advance Sunspot Cycle Phase;
The 1st Player (C8) advances the Sunspot Cube clockwise, which may trigger a threshold:;
"a. Event Threshold. If the cube crosses an ""event"" threshold, make an Event Roll (K2) and resolve the event (which is applied to all players, starting with the 1st Player).";
"b. Seniority Threshold. If the cube crosses the ""SENIORITY"" threshold, remove a Seniority Disk. If no disks remain, the game immediately ends with scoring per M2. Player order can change if using Module 0 (O6b).";
;
E. Hands & Stacks;
Hand Cards represent patented know-how. By moving a Hand card into a Stack (either White-Side up by boosting it to LEO or Black-Side up by ET production at a Factory in space), it becomes a tangible object.;
E1. Hand Cards;
Store your Hand cards to the right of your playmat.;
a. No Hand Limit. Your Hand can contain any number of cards. However academia hand limits apply (I2a).;
b. Open Hands. Your FTs, Hand cards, and Stacks are free for anyone to examine.;
E2. Stacks;
A Stack is a collection of cards and/or FTs, placed in a designated slot on your playmat. In the core game, you can have up to 4 Stacks: LEO, Rocket, Outpost #1, and Outpost #2. Store these in the named slots on your playmat. Each has a location on the map as indicated by the location of its Figure.;
a. No Card Limits. Your Stacks can contain any number of cards or FTs. However, you may not move a Rocket if its Wet Mass is greater than 32 or its Dry Mass is greater than 23.;
b. Stack Figures. If a Stack is created (except for LEO), place a Figure/outpost chit on the map to indicate its location (E5, E6). Except for LEO, you cannot create a Stack if you do not have a Figure/outpost chit for it.;
c. Stack Creation. Stacks are created by cargo transfer (G1), boosting (I4), site refuel (I5), or ET production (I8).;
d. Stack Swapping & Negotiated Transfer. See G1e and N3.;
e. Empty Stacks. If no cards or FTs remain in a Stack, Discard its Figure or outpost chit from the map.;
Also Discard any Glitches.;

E3. Number of Stacks Permitted;
To represent the limits of mission control and spacesuited Humans, you are strictly limited to one each of the following Stacks at the end of your Turn:;
a. Rocket Stack Ц represented on the map by your Rocket Figure.;
b. LEO Stack Ц is always at the Space on the map marked LEO, and is not represented by a Figure.;
c. Outpost Stack 1 Ц represented on the map by your #1 Outpost Chit.;
d. Outpost Stack 2 Ц represented on the map by your #2 Outpost Chit. During your Turn you may create as many Outpost Stacks as you wish, but by the end of your Turn you must have no more than two of them.;
e. Freighter Stack (Module 1) Ц represented on the map by your big cube.;
f. Kalpana Bernal Stack (Module 2) Ц represented on the map by a finned sphere figure of your player color.;
g. Stanford Bernal Stack (Module 2) Ц represented on the map by a torus figure of your player color.;
EASILY FORGOTTEN: A Stack can be made up of just FTs on an Outpost. A Stack could also be made up of a collection of cards (e.g. a Rocket) and its FTs. [E3];
EASILY FORGOTTEN: In the core game, you are only allowed one Spacecraft, your Rocket Stack. [E3a];
E4. LEO Stack Creation;
Your LEO Stack is like an outpost that is permanently located in Low Earth Orbit (marked УLEOФ on the map). Its cards and Aquas reside in the УLEO StackФ slot on your playmat. Unlike other Stacks, this Stack does not have its own Figure.18;
a. Creation. See E2c. The boost operation will normally be used to create your first LEO Stack.;
E5. Rocket Stack Creation;
Designate a Stack as a Rocket Stack by placing its cards and/or FTs in the designated Rocket slot on your playmat.19 It must include an activated thruster to move (H2), but a Crew is not required and any Stack can be designated a Rocket Stack. Indicate its location on the map using a Rocket Figure. Place a Dry Mass Chit on your playmatТs Fuel Strip according to the RocketТs Mass.;
a. Creation. See E2c. The cargo transfer free action will normally be used to create your first Rocket Stack in LEO by transferring cards from your LEO Stack to your Rocket Stack.;
b. Rocket Stack Limit. You may only have one Rocket Stack at a time. If you already have a Rocket Stack, before another is created you must first either Decommission your existing Rocket Stack (free action per G6) or turn it into an Outpost Stack (free action per E6).;
c. Place Dry Mass Chit. Your Dry Mass is the sum of each cardТs Mass (B2b) plus 1 for each FT in the Rocket Stack. Place your Dry Mass Chit for your Rocket in the spot on your Fuel Strip with this number (F2b).;
. Fueling & Wet Mass Chit. When first created, a RocketТs tanks are empty. Indicate this by selecting a Wet Mass Chit of the same color (F4b) as the Spacecraft's thrust triangle and placing it on top of your Dry Mass Chit. If you wish to immediately add Fuel to your Rocket, either by cargo transfer (G1) or site refuel (I5), move the Wet Mass Chit to the right per (F3b);
