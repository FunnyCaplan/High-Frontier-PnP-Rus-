These Core rules (including the glossary at the end) comprise the base game, and are expanded by the tutorials, variants, and modules
A1. Core Overview
Players, representing the spacefaring factions of Earth, bid for patents (space technology cards) and boost them into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to be assembled into Rockets and their Cargos. Water in LEO is used both as commodity currency and as rocket propellant, and each water container there is called one Aqua. Once loaded with Fuel Tanks (FTs) of water, Rockets fly to promising industrial and science Sites (planets, asteroids, etc.). If prospecting succeeds, a Claim is made. A Claim can be upgraded to a Factory to produce useful new equipment. By extracting water from a Site, FTs are produced both for water propellant and as money (“Aqua”) if shipped back to LEO.
a. Core Game Victory. At the end of 48 years (48 Turns per player), the winner is the player with the highest victory point (VP) total.
b. Sunspot Cycles. Each Turn in High Frontier is one year, and the length of a game is measured in Sunspot Cycles of 12 years. Thus the standard Core Game described above is 4 Sunspot Cycles, Core Game plus Modules 1 and/or 2 is 5 Sunspot Cycles, and Core Game plus Modules 1, 2, and Futures is 7 Sunspot Cycles
